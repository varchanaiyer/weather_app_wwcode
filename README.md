# Weather Forecasting App

This repository contains the code for a simple weather forecasting app developed through a series of blogs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need pip, which is included in most Python distributions.

### Installing

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/weather-forecasting-app.git`

Navigate into the repository using `cd weather-forecasting-app`

Install the necessary packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt



### Running

To run the app, first start the backend:

python backend/app.py

Then open `frontend/index.html` in your browser.

## Architecture

The backend of the app is built with Python. It fetches real-time weather data, preprocesses a dataset, trains a machine learning model for weather prediction, and uploads the data to AWS S3.

The front end is a simple web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
